# drug-shop

##Inctruction
To launch the project, just follow the link. https://romanmartseniuk.github.io/drug-shop/

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the "database" was created locally, so it is static and orders are currently saved as a message in the console. Also, there is currently no adaptation and some bugs are possible.
